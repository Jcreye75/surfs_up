# Surfs_up
## Overview of the analysis: 
W. Avy likes your analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## What was created:
This new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You will submit the following:
- Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
- Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
- Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis

## Resources
- Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
- Software: Git version 2.33.0.windows.2, Visyal Studio 1.62.2, Flask 2.0.2, Python 3.7.6, Werkzeug 2.0.2

## Summary:
Per the information obtained and presented previously:
- Temperature comparison between June and December, both months show means quite close (June 74.94 & Dec 71.04)
- Precipitation comparison between June and December also shows means quite close (June 0.13 & Dec 0.21)
- Historical Precipitation shows for both similar trends and means, except for three outstanding dates in December where December reached 4, 5, 6 values (isolated events) vs June where only one outstanding event in 4.

## Conclusion and Proposal
Both seasons shows similar weather, so data supports that a surf and ice cream shop business are both sustainable year-round.
